# SpeechRecog_CNN

https://yerevann.github.io/2015/10/11/spoken-language-identification-with-deep-convolutional-networks/ showed that CNNs are very good at identifying what language is being spoken give multiple languages.

This repository is for my exploration of CNNs in language recognition. I am currently using file from http://shtooka.net/download.php from eight languages. I am still searching for other freely available spoke word databases that contain recordings across many languages and multiple speakers within each language.

The purpose of this work is to examine the features that the CNN architecture deems as important for distinguishing different languages.
