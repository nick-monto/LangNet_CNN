<a href="https://yerevann.github.io/2015/10/11/spoken-language-identification-with-deep-convolutional-networks/">Hrayr Harutyunyan</a> showed that CNNs are very good at identifying what language is being spoken give multiple languages.

This repository is for my exploration of CNNs in language recognition. I am currently using file from several <a href="http://shtooka.net/download.php">Shtooka</a> databases spanning eight languages. I am still searching for other freely available spoke word databases that contain recordings across many languages and multiple speakers within each language.

The purpose of this work is to examine the features that the CNN architecture deems as important for distinguishing different languages.

During the preprocessing, there are two other folders. One folder containing the Flac files from Shtooka and one folder containing the converted flac - wav files. I have not uploaded these as they each contain over 6000 files.
